# Multitask Learning of Negation and Speculation with Negation-focused Pre-training

The input data and model should be placed in a subdirectory `/input/`. After that, running `run-models.ipynb` will execute file `nlp_project.py` (defined in global variable FILEPATH, which you may need to edit) that trains the models to provide the main results for our project. The results will be written to a tsv file `output.tsv`

We have also included code for baselines, as well as parser scripts for older versions of our logs.
